## How to submit changes

If you're new to GitHub, we highly suggest you check out the **First time contributing** link in the [Important resources](#important-resources) section. It explains everything from committing your changes to creating a pull request.

With Miunie, a pull request must pass all Unit Tests and get a code review by a staff member. Once you create it, however, don't worry, we will check it as soon as possible.

:blush: We all make mistakes, so don't worry about it. After all, it's a learning experience. If you have any questions, feel free to ask on our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/cGhEZuk) or in the appropriate comment section. Nobody is here to mock anyone and we appreciate **any contribution** no matter how small.

### First time contributing
Here are some tips to help you understand our style before you contribute your first changes.

* Write your commit message in the present tense - _"Add file" not "Added file"_
* Provide detailed descriptions of what you did.

## Found a bug?

To report a :bug: bug, create a new [Issue](https://github.com/petrspelos/Community-Discord-BOT/issues/new) and try to describe it as much as possible. Here are some tips:

* Write a guide to reproducing the problem if possible
* Add some information about your system, such as OS, CPU, GPU, etc.
* You can also follow a cool template, like [this one](https://gist.github.com/auremoser/72803ba969d0e61ff070).

And if you can fix the bug as well, that would be super stellar! :revolving_hearts:

## Style Guide
To make sure we all understand each other's code, we have a unified standard to follow.

The standard is derived from [JetBrain's Resharper](https://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/) default settings. ReSharper is a Visual Studio extension that helps you with styling, debugging and IntelliSense. If you follow its advice, you will conform to out style.

### Or do it manually
Feel free to check out [MSDN Coding Conventions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/inside-a-program/coding-conventions). We, however, recommend you look through the project to better understand the style we use. Don't worry, nobody will reject your contribution because of a line-break.
